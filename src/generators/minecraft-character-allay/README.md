## Creating the texture files

Place the texture files into a directory named `textures-original`, such as

```
textures-original/minecraft-1.16.5
```

Then run the command:

```
npm run blocks:makeTextures
```

This will generate files in the `textures` directory.

Commit these files to the repo.

**Do not commit the original texture files to the repo, only commit the generated merged texture file**
